JUST SOME BASIC CONCEPTS YOU SHOULD APPLY YOUR OWN CRITICAL THINKING.
_______________________________________________________________________

# Excessive trust in client-side controls (poor backend)
- `just mess around with the backend`

# 2FA (2 Factor Authorization) broken logic / bypass
 - `bruteforce might be a valid option,
 - take the seesion token after that
 - try: When prompted for the verification code, manually change the URL 
 - to navigate to specific endpoints`

# Failing to handle unconventional input
- supply negatives 
- things that aren't meant to be understood by the logic
- create pure anomaly and lookout for bugs
- Insane amounts or requests`

# Inconsistent handling of exceptional input
- `Try random attacks null byte payloads and bug the system
- add very-long-strings atleast 200 characters long`

# Password reset broken logic
- `try to reset/ delete password apply proxy and try things`

# Inconsistent security controls
- `chaange your phone, number, email to something you don't have access to 
- even better find out someone else's and try out theirs,
- reuse coupons; when failing try different things maybe alternate betn the coupons...
- got one coupon? well try to get some more, maybe same way maybe a workaround`

# Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint
- `proxy requests modify some, delete some and play around with it
- check which coding appears to bypass the server's validation`

- login
"without auth"
"weak backend"
"exif data"
