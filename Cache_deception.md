A static web page is one that:
- Is pre-built and stored on the server as is (usually .html, .css, .js files)
- Does not change based on who’s visiting or what they’re doing
- Is served exactly the same to every user, every time

Focus on endpoints that support the GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS methods

//Caches may have rules based on specific static extensions.
 Try a range of extensions including:
   Cache File Types: -
   `.js, .css, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .svg, .woff, .ttf,
                       .mp4, .mp3, .ico, .wasm, .exe `


Common cache-phrase :   `-X-Cache   -X-Cache-Lookup   -Cache-Control    -Age
                         -Expires   -cf-cache-status    -Fastly-Cache      
                         -X-Proxy-Cache     -X-Drupal-Cache `
       
 Common static page directories: /static, /assets, /scripts /images /resources
      
(note: cache key is the request line & dynamic cache means no cache)

#sometimes the server caches data in /abc/../resource format and something quite the
 alternative such as /resource/../abc 'here static si the static directory and abc is'
                                       'the page (myaccount/profile/whatever)'

#"Some things to keep in mind."#

$ NULL byte = %00 [OpenliteSpeed {might not work sometimes}, Akamai , Fastly(CDNs)]
                                            /profile%00 = profile

$ Encoded slash = %2F [NGINx, (may work in akamai/cloudfront but rarely)]
                         /api%2Fv1 = api/v1

$ Semi-Colon = ; [apache, tomcat, fastly, cloudflare]
                        /index.php;a=b = /index.php

$ Query and Fragement = ? and # [ cloudflare, akamai ]
 
                             
$ Tab and space encoding = %09 and %20 [ akamai ]
                           /path%20image.js = /path image.js

$ Double Slash = // [ mostly many ]
                         /path//image.png = /path/image.png


 FILES LIKE THESE :robots.txt, index.html, favicon.ico ARE SUPER HELPFUL IF THE SERVER SERVES THESE
 
 'for example you can try one of these and the server might cache it'

//cache control is green flag

- X-Cache
- X-Cache: hit 
- X-Cache: miss

//dynamic cache is red flag
- X-Cache: dynamic

//no store value is red flag

//no cache is red flag
